# BlockChainGrok
A small test program used to download blockchain data from blockchain.info for the Peter R vs CSW challenge, as seen on reddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6q2uak/peter_rizun_and_craig_wright_just_bet_1_btc_on_a/

Compile against Qt 5.x -- qmake project file included. To compile, I suggest using qmake to generate a Makefile or using Qt Creator to open the .pro file directly.

Requires a C++11 or better compiler (most modern systems have this).

I promise you this won't break your computer or steal your bitcoins or data.  It's a safe program!
